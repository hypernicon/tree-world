# Tree World -- A Simple Spatially Aware Agent Driven by Basically Drives

Tree World is a toy experiment to build a simple agent that is driven to explore and satisfy basic needs, such as hunger. In doing so, the agent learns about space through its actions and sensors. 

This experiment is a first approach to a broader plan laid out in my blog, [Embodied Language and Cognition](https://embodiedlanguage.substack.com/p/charting-a-path-to-agi-through-robotics).
